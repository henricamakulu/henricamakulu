## Hi, I'm Henrica 👋

Just an everyday girl from Harare Zimbabwe who loves Jesus, data and people.

I always knew I wanted to change the world, I just didn't know how. From a humble background being raised by a single mother and selling sweets to get by in university to being known as Zimbabwe's first female data scientist and travelling to Silicon Valley, my journey has been nothing short of a miracle!

Today, my vision is to transform lives using data and I do this in my vocation as a data scientist and in my community as a mentor, trainer and speaker.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Senior Specialist Consultant at Medscheme Holdings
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to implement machine learning projects
